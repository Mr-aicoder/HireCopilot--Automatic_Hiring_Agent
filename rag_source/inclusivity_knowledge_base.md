# Inclusive Language Best Practices for Job Descriptions

## 1. Avoid Gendered Language
- **Instead of:** he, she, his, her
- **Use:** they, them, their, you

## 2. Avoid Biased or Aggressive Terminology
- **Instead of:** rockstar, ninja, guru, wizard, hacker
- **Use:** skilled, expert, proficient, experienced developer/engineer

- **Instead of:** hunt, attack, crush
- **Use:** find, achieve, exceed

## 3. Scrutinize "Requirements" vs. "Nice-to-Haves"
- An overly long list of "must-have" requirements can discourage qualified candidates, especially those from underrepresented groups, from applying.
- **Guideline:** Clearly separate "Required Qualifications" from "Preferred Qualifications" or "Nice-to-Haves." Limit true requirements to the absolute essentials for the role. Ask yourself, "Could someone succeed in this role without this specific skill?"

## 4. Avoid Corporate Jargon and Idioms
- **Instead of:** "hit the ground running", "work hard, play hard"
- **Use:** Clear, direct language like "quickly contribute to projects" or describe the company culture explicitly.

## 5. Focus on Growth and Learning
- **Instead of:** "expert in X, Y, and Z"
- **Use:** "experience with X, Y, and a willingness to learn Z." This signals that you value development and potential, not just existing mastery.
